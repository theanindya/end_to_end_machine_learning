# End-to-End Machine Learning

## Overview

Welcome to the **ML Model Deployment for Student Performance Prediction using AWS & CI/CD** project! This repository contains comprehensive resources and code for building, training, and deploying machine learning models.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Scripts for cleaning and preparing raw data for analysis.
- **Feature Engineering**: Tools to create and select the best features for your model.
- **Model Training**: Code to train machine learning models on processed data.
- **Model Evaluation**: Scripts to evaluate the performance of trained models.
- **Model Deployment**: Tools to deploy trained models for production use.

## How It Works

This project aims to provide a complete pipeline for machine learning projects, from data preprocessing to model deployment. It is designed to be a hands-on resource for both beginners and experienced practitioners in the field of machine learning.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/theanindya/end_to_end_machine_learning.git
cd end_to_end_machine_learning
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installation

Ensure you have Python and pip installed. Then, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

The project includes a series of Python scripts that guide you through the entire machine learning pipeline. Each script focuses on a specific aspect of the pipeline:

1. **Data Preprocessing**
2. **Feature Engineering**: 
3. **Model Training**
4. **Model Evaluation**
5. **Model Deployment**
